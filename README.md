Hi, my name is Joshua Sanchez. I really like video games, and that’s what got me into coding. I don’t have a lot of experience yet, but I’m excited to learn.
I want to use GitHub to help me keep track of my work and learn how to work with other people on coding projects. I hope that by using it, I can get better at coding and maybe one day help make games too.
